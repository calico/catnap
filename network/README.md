# Overview

This module contains the code needed to reproduce the consensus clustering results of the paper.

The TVGL sub-module / directory is taken from https://github.com/davidhallac/TVGL but has been modified slightly
to accept the empirical covariance matrix directly instead of computing it in the TVGL function.

This was done to allow us to estimate the covariance using the nonparanormal SKEPTIC estimator instead.

Unfortunately, the TVGL code seems to have dependencies which are not Python 3 compatible, we include a
separate requirements.txt that should contain all the Python 2 packages needed to run the code (although
this is likely to be brittle as Python 2 support has ended for many of these modules).

## Layout

`utils.py` contains general helper functions for estimating covariance and calling TVGL.

`consensus_clustering.py` contains the code specific to running our consensus clustering procedure as outlined in the
paper on dataframes that are generated by `data_processing/feature_processing.py`.
